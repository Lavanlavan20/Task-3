## Project Overview

This repository holds the materials for Task-3: small exercises, example scripts, and demonstration code. It's intended to be straightforward to run and adapt for education or assessment purposes.

## Languages & Tech

- Primary languages: (update as needed â€” e.g., JavaScript, Python)
- Tools: git, (node / npm) or (python / pip) depending on included code

> Note: Replace the above list with the actual languages and tools present in the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the tools required for the project. Typical examples:

- git
- Node.js (if project includes JavaScript/Node code)
